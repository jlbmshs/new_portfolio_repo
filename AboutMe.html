           <h2>Hobbies</h2>
           Some of the hobbies I like to do are playing sports, attending sports
          games, working on the computer and also watching any type of sport event.
          I like to do this because sports to me are very interesting and they can
          help me forget about any problems and let me just focus on the game. I like
          hobbies because they can keep me away from problems but at the same time
          have me work on something that I truly care about.

          <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
          Some of the accomplishments that I have accomplished in my life have been
          graduating 8th grade, playing sports, getting straight A's and also meeting
          and talking to some famous athletes.
